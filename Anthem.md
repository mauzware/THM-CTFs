- You'll see bunch of errors with Gobuster, but don't worry about them. In `/robots.txt` you will find a password and CMS for website. Domain name is written at the bottom of main page.

  ```
  UmbracoIsTheBest! 

  # Use for all search robots
  User-agent: *
  
  # Define the directories not to crawl
  Disallow: /bin/
  Disallow: /config/
  Disallow: /umbraco/
  Disallow: /umbraco_client/
  ```
  
- OK, so this one took a while, I spent a lot of time googling different things, but in order to get the answers for last two questions you have to google the poem written by one of the users...

  ```
  Born on a Monday,
  Christened on Tuesday,
  Married on Wednesday,
  Took ill on Thursday,
  Grew worse on Friday,
  Died on Saturday,
  Buried on Sunday.
  That was the end‚Ä¶ 
  ```

- Google will give you the author name and for the email just follow the pattern of Jane Doe email.

## üåê Spot the flags

- So here, I actaully finished this task before the first one lol. All the flags are in the source codes of different pages. I found them naturally during exploration.

  ```
  http://10.10.8.217 source code -> THM{G!T_G00D}

  http://10.10.8.217/archive/we-are-hiring/ source code -> THM{L0L_WH0_US3S_M3T4}
  
  http://10.10.8.217/archive/a-cheers-to-our-it-department/ source code -> THM{AN0TH3R_M3TA}
  
  http://10.10.8.217/authors/jane-doe/ source code -> THM{L0L_WH0_D15}
  ```
  
- Let's finish the job.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Final stage

- I got the right credentials for username on my 5th or 6th try. Just use the administrators credentials and the password that we found. I won't write the credentials here, I'll let you think a bit about them. It is a really common combination for the usernames.
  
- I used `rdesktop` to login but you can use `xfreerdp3` or `Remmina` depending on your preferance. User flag is on the desktop. `THM{N00T_NO0T}`
  
- So for the root flag, I allowed hidden files to be visible and found folder `backup` with `restore.txt` inside. Unfortunately, we can't read the content inside.

- Here, I spent some time trying various different commands in PowerShell in order to get access to the content, but nothing worked. What worked for me is changing the Security Properties of `restore.txt`.
  I honestly don't know why `icacls` didn't work, it even gave me the output `C:\backup\restore.txt Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files`.

  ```
  Right Click on the file
  Properties
  Security
  Add
  then add your user and allow Read, Write commands
  i allowed everything just to be safe
  ```

- From this point it's a tutorial, take the Administrator password and login as Administrator. Root flag is waiting for you on Desktop.

## üèÅ Flags

- **User Flag**: `THM{N00T_NO0T}`
- **Root Flag**: `THM{Y0U_4R3_1337}`

## üí¨ Notes & Reflections

- What was challenging in this room for me?
  `Honestly, I thought that it will be much harder, it took a little bit of googling to escalate but that's it.`

- What did I learn?
  `New way of privelege escalation on Windows.`

- I would recommend this room or any type of CTF challenge to every Cyber Security enthusiast since it will sharpen your skills better than any book/tutorial/course or walkthrough rooms on many different platforms!

- Thank you for reading! Enjoy, Have Fun and Happy Hacking! ü§ü
