## üîç Ready, set, go!

- Q1 : Can you decode the following? `VEhNe2p1NTdfZDNjMGQzXzdoM19iNDUzfQ==`
  <br>

  It's a Base64 encoding.

  ```
  echo 'VEhNe2p1NTdfZDNjMGQzXzdoM19iNDUzfQ==' | base64 -d
  THM{ju57_d3c0d3_7h3_b453}
  ```
  
- Q2 : Meta! meta! meta! meta...................................
  <br>

  Download the file and upload it to `exiftool` <br> `Owner Name	THM{3x1f_0r_3x17}`
  
- Q3 : Something is hiding. That's all you need to know.
  <br>

  Download the file, ITS STEGO BOI AND MOMMY !!!! ü¶ï‚ù§Ô∏è Extract the message with `steghide` and read it, there is no passphrase just press enter.

  ```
  sudo apt install steghide
  
  steghide --extract -sf Extinction_1577976250757.jpg
  Enter passphrase: 
  wrote extracted data to "Final_message.txt".
  
  cat Final_message.txt 
  It going to be over soon. Sleep my child.
  
  THM{500n3r_0r_l473r_17_15_0ur_7urn}
  ```

- Q4 : Huh, where is the flag? `THM{wh173_fl46}`

- Q5 : Such technology is quite reliable.
  <br>

  Download the file and use `zbarimg` to extract flag from the QR code.

  ```
  sudo apt install zbartools
  
  zbarimg QR_1577976698747.png 
  QR-Code:THM{qr_m4k3_l1f3_345y}
  scanned 1 barcode symbols from 1 images in 0 seconds
  ```

- Q6 : Reverse it or read it? Both works, it's all up to you.
  <br>

  Download the file upload it to CyberChef  `THM{345y_f1nd_345y_60} Hello there, wish you have a nice day`

- Q7 : Can you decode it? `3agrSy1CewF9v8ukcSkPSYm3oKUoByUpKG4L`
  <br>

  This is Base58, CyberChef will do the job. `THM{17_h45_l3553r_l3773r5}`

- Q8 : Left, right, left, right... Rot 13 is too mainstream. Solve this `MAF{atbe_max_vtxltk}`
  <br>

  Cipher Identifier will tell you that is ROT Cipher and will decode it `THM{hail_the_caesar}`

- Q9 : Make a comment. I'm hungry now... I need the flag
  <br>

  When I saw this I knew that developer tools will do the job quickly. Flag is in the `<div>` of this question. `THM{4lw4y5_ch3ck_7h3_c0m3mn7}`

- Q10 : I accidentally messed up with this PNG file. Can you help me fix it? Thanks, ^^
  <br>

  OK, I did this one with `hexedit` and it's very simple, change first 4 bytes to this `89 50 4E 47`, just be careful when editing.

  ```
  sudo apt install hexedit
  
  hexedit spoil_1577979329740.png

  change first 4 bytes to this -> 89 50 4E 47
  
  save and exit -> CTRL+X Y
  
  open the image and it will show the flag THM{y35_w3_c4n}
  ```

- Q11 : Some hidden flag inside Tryhackme social account.
  <br>

  Hidden message is on Reddit, its Base64 and when decoded it will provide another message, just use the provided dork and you can't miss it.

  ```
  https://www.reddit.com/r/tryhackme/comments/jy8p3p/about_ctf_collection_vol1/
  SlVTVCBPTkUgTU9SRSBTVEVQICEhISEhISEhIApzaXRlOiJyZWRkaXQuY29tIiBpbnRleHQ6IlRITSIgaW50aXRsZToidHJ5aGFja21l

  echo 'SlVTVCBPTkUgTU9SRSBTVEVQICEhISEhISEhIApzaXRlOiJyZWRkaXQuY29tIiBpbnRleHQ6IlRITSIgaW50aXRsZToidHJ5aGFja21l' | base64 -d
  JUST ONE MORE STEP !!!!!!!! 
  site:"reddit.com" intext:"THM" intitle:"tryhackme

  THM{50c14l_4cc0un7_15_p4r7_0f_051n7}
  ```

- Q12 : What is this? `++++++++++[>+>+++>+++++++>++++++++++<<<<-]>>>++++++++++++++.------------.+++++.>+++++++++++++++++++++++.<<++++++++++++++++++.>>-------------------.---------.++++++++++++++.++++++++++++.<++++++++++++++++++.+++++++++.<+++.+.>----.>++++.`
  <br>
  
  Cipher Identifier will do the job, I almost died from laughing when I saw name of the cipher lol... `THM{0h_my_h34d}`

- Q13 : Exclusive strings for everyone!

  `S1: 44585d6b2368737c65252166234f20626d`
  `S2: 1010101010101010101010101010101010`

  OK, so for this one you have to do S1 XOR S2. I made a Python script for this one but there are many other ways to do it.

  ```
  nano xor.py
  s1 = bytes.fromhex("44585d6b2368737c65252166234f20626d")
  s2 = bytes.fromhex("1010101010101010101010101010101010")
  
  flag = bytes([a ^ b for a, b in zip(s1, s2)])
  print(flag.decode())
  
  python3 xor.py 
  THM{3xclu51v3_0r}
  ```

- Q14 : Binary walk. Please exfiltrate my file :)
  <br>

  Download the file then use `binwalk` to extract the directory then read the message.

  ```
  binwalk hell_1578018688127.jpg 

  DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION

  cat hello_there.txt                 
  Thank you for extracting me, you are the best!
  
  THM{y0u_w4lk_m3_0u7}
  ```

- Q15 : There is something lurking in the dark. What does the flag said?
  <br>

  Download the image and use `stegsolve` to read the flag by pressing left arrow on keyboard. Here's the [installation](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/Stegsolve)

  ```
  java -jar stegsolve.jar
  open image
  press left arrow
  
  THM{7h3r3_15_h0p3_1n_d4rkn355}
  ```

- Q16 : How good is your listening skill? P/S: The flag formatted as `THM{Listened Flag}`, the flag should be in All CAPS.
  <br>

  THIS ONE IS A BANGER HAHAHAHAHAHA LOVE IT! Download the file and use zbarimg to get the link then it's on you.

  ```
  zbarimg QRCTF_1579095601577.png 
  QR-Code:https://soundcloud.com/user-86667759/thm-ctf-vol1
  scanned 1 barcode symbols from 1 images in 0 seconds
  
  THM{SOUNDINGQR}
  ```

- Q17 : Dig up the past. Sometimes we need a 'machine' to dig the past.

  `
  Targetted website: https://www.embeddedhacker.com/
  Targetted time: 2 January 2020
  `

  This one is pretty simple, `archive.org` will do the job for you.

  ```
  archive.org
  https://web.archive.org/web/20200102131252/https://www.embeddedhacker.com/
  THM{ch3ck_th3_h4ckb4ck} 
  ```

- Q18 : Can you solve the following? By the way, I lost the key. Sorry >.< `MYKAHODTQ{RVG_YVGGK_FAL_WXF}` Flag format: TRYHACKME{FLAG IN ALL CAP}
  <br>

  Yeaaah right, it's uncrackable for sure, use CyberChef Viginere Decode with key `thm` `TRYHACKME{YOU_FOUND_THE_KEY}`

- Q19 : Decode the following text. `581695969015253365094191591547859387620042736036246486373595515576333693`
  <br>

  This one was a bit tricky ngl, it goes from decimal to hexadecimal. Use [this tool](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html) for converting decimal to hex. CyberChef will decode it from hex.

  ```
  original string:
  581695969015253365094191591547859387620042736036246486373595515576333693
  
  decimal to hex:
  54484D7B31375F6A7535375F346E5F307264316E3472795F62343533357D
  
  then put hex string to CyberChef
  THM{17_ju57_4n_0rd1n4ry_b4535}
  ```

- Q20 : I just hacked my neighbor's WiFi and try to capture some packet. He must be up to no good. Help me find it.
  <br>

  As you already know, Wireshark is the GOAT when it comes to packets. Use `http` filter then `Follow HTTP stream` on packet 1825.

  ```

## üí¨ Notes & Reflections

- What was challenging in this room for me?ü¶ï
  `Finding right tools...`

- What did I learn?
  `Few new tools, more practice with Crypto and Steganography and most importantly I met my boi Stego again! That listening QR code is something else ngl...` ü¶ï

- I would recommend this room or any type of CTF challenge to every Cyber Security enthusiast since it will sharpen your skills better than any book/tutorial/course or walkthrough rooms on many different platforms!

- Thank you for reading! Enjoy, Have Fun and Happy Hacking! ü§ü
