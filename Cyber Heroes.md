## üîç Bypassing login

- When you visit the login page, in the source code you can find this:

  ```
    <script>
    function authenticate() {
      a = document.getElementById('uname')
      b = document.getElementById('pass')
      const RevereString = str => [...str].reverse().join('');
      if (a.value=="h3ck3rBoi" & b.value==RevereString("54321@terceSrepuS")) { 
        var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
          if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
            document.getElementById("flag").innerHTML = this.responseText ;
            document.getElementById("todel").innerHTML = "";
            document.getElementById("rm").remove() ;
          }
        };
        xhttp.open("GET", "RandomLo0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0gpath12345_Flag_"+a.value+"_"+b.value+".txt", true);
        xhttp.send();
      }
      else {
        alert("Incorrect Password, try again.. you got this hacker !")
      }
    }
  </script>
  ```
  
- Reverse the string `54321@terceSrepuS` and login with newly found credentials to get the flag.

  ```
