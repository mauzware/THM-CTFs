## üîç Enumeration

- Starting with Nmap scan and Ffuf.

  ```
  nmap -sC -sV -T5 -p- 10.10.122.13

  PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
  80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.14.0 (Ubuntu)
  | http-git: 
  |   10.10.122.13:80/.git/
  |     Git repository found!
  |_    Repository description: Unnamed repository; edit this file 'description' to name the...
  |_http-server-header: nginx/1.14.0 (Ubuntu)
  |_http-title: Super Awesome Site!
  Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
  ```

  ```
  ffuf -u http://10.10.122.13/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

  .git/HEAD               [Status: 200, Size: 23, Words: 2, Lines: 2, Duration: 59ms]
  css                     [Status: 301, Size: 194, Words: 7, Lines: 8, Duration: 49ms]
  index.html              [Status: 200, Size: 6890, Words: 541, Lines: 61, Duration: 49ms]
  :: Progress: [4614/4614] :: Job [1/1] :: 836 req/sec :: Duration: [0:00:06] :: Errors: 0 ::
  ```
  
- When I visited the login page I tried to get access to it but it was unsuccessful. Downloaded the `/.git/HEAD` which pointed me to `/.git/refs/heads/master`
  
- It was a dead end so I decided to check the Git directory. I did some manual exploration but after a few minutes, I actually downloaded the full `/.git/objects` directory since it had a lot inside and I didn't want to go manually through all of them.

- The thing is, when you download Git directory, if it is named as source IP, you can actually use Git commands inside of it, so I did that.

  ```
  wget -m -k http://10.10.122.13/.git/objects/

  cd 10.10.122.13
  ```

- First I checked for all the logs.

  ```

      Initial commit
  ```

- OK, one of these commits looked very suspicious to me so I checked the actual commit and found the password inside. That's the whole challenge.

  ```git diff [find-it-on-your-own]```

## üí¨ Notes & Reflections

- What was challenging in this room for me?
  `Getting my way around it. This room is pure enumeration room tho.`

- What did I learn?
  `This was my first expereience with hacking Git if you can actually call it like that.`

- I would recommend this room or any type of CTF challenge to every Cyber Security enthusiast since it will sharpen your skills better than any book/tutorial/course or walkthrough rooms on many different platforms!

- Thank you for reading! Enjoy, Have Fun and Happy Hacking! ü§ü
