## üîç Enumeration

- Starting off with Nmap scan. I also ran Gobuster but it found nothing.

  ```
  nmap -sC -sV -T5 -p- 10.10.226.182

  PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
  22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
  | ssh-hostkey:

  ```
  
- In the source code of web app you can find two interesting things, Pokemon names and SSH credentials.

  ```
      <script type="text/javascript">
    	const randomPokemon = [
    		'Bulbasaur', 'Charmander', 'Squirtle',
    		'Snorlax',
    		'Zapdos',
    		'Mew',
    		'Charizard',
    		'Grimer',
    		'Metapod',
    		'Magikarp'
    	];
    	const original = randomPokemon.sort((pokemonName) => {
    		const [aLast] = pokemonName.split(', ');
    	});

    	console.log(original);
    </script>


        </div>
        <pokemon>:<hack_the_pokemon>
        	<!--(Check console for extra surprise!)-->
      </div>
  ```
  
- Let's login and catch them all!

## üëë Catching Them All and Root Privilege Escalation

- First Pokemon is in the ZIP file in Desktop directory, extract the file and read the note.

  ```
  pokemon@root:~$ cd Desktop/
  pokemon@root:~/Desktop$ ls -al
  total 12
  drwxr-xr-x  2 pokemon pokemon 4096 Jun 24  2020 .
  drwxr-xr-x 19 pokemon pokemon 4096 May 13 10:41 ..
  -rw-rw-r--  1 pokemon pokemon  383 Jun 22  2020 P0kEmOn.zip
  
  pokemon@root:~/Desktop$ unzip P0kEmOn.zip 
  Archive:  P0kEmOn.zip
     creating: P0kEmOn/
    inflating: P0kEmOn/grass-type.txt
   
  pokemon@root:~/Desktop$ ls -al
  total 16
  drwxr-xr-x  3 pokemon pokemon 4096 May 13 10:51 .
  drwxr-xr-x 19 pokemon pokemon 4096 May 13 10:41 ..
  drwxrwxr-x  2 pokemon pokemon 4096 Jun 22  2020 P0kEmOn
  -rw-rw-r--  1 pokemon pokemon  383 Jun 22  2020 P0kEmOn.zip
  
  pokemon@root:~/Desktop$ cd P0kEmOn/
  pokemon@root:~/Desktop/P0kEmOn$ ls -al
  total 12
  drwxrwxr-x 2 pokemon pokemon 4096 Jun 22  2020 .
  drwxr-xr-x 3 pokemon pokemon 4096 May 13 10:51 ..
  -rw-rw-r-- 1 pokemon pokemon   53 Jun 22  2020 grass-type.txt
  
  pokemon@root:~/Desktop/P0kEmOn$ cat grass-type.txt 
  50 6f 4b 65 4d 6f 4e 7b 42 75 6c 62 61 73 61 75 72 7d
  ```
  
- It's encoded in hexadecimal, use any tool that you like for decoding, I have my own scripts for that.

  ```
  What you wanna do? encode or decode? decode
  Enter Hex string for decoding: 50 6f 4b 65 4d 6f 4e 7b 42 75 6c 62 61 73 61 75 72 7d
  Decode Hex value: PoKeMoN{Bulbasaur}
  ```
  
- I found another user credentials in `/Videos/Gotta/Catch/Them/ALL!`.

  ```
  pokemon@root:~/Videos/Gotta/Catch/Them/ALL!$ ls -al
  total 12
  drwxrwxr-x 2 pokemon pokemon 4096 Jun 22  2020 .
  drwxrwxr-x 3 pokemon pokemon 4096 Jun 22  2020 ..
  -rw-r--r-- 1 pokemon root      78 Jun 22  2020 Could_this_be_what_Im_looking_for?.cplusplus
  
  pokemon@root:~/Videos/Gotta/Catch/Them/ALL!$ cat Could_this_be_what_Im_looking_for\?.cplusplus 
  # include <iostream>
  
  int main() {
          std::cout << "ash : pikapika"
          return 0;
  ```

- I already tried accessing `ash` directory and reading `roots-pokemon.txt` but got denied. After logging in as `ash`, I tried it again but it was unsuccessful as well. Here's the catch, ash can run `sudo -l`.

  ```
  ash@root:/home$ sudo -l
  [sudo] password for ash: 
  Matching Defaults entries for ash on root:
      env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
  
  User ash may run the following commands on root:
      (ALL : ALL) ALL
  ```

- Well, we can run any command as sudo, so just switch to root now. Also, read the `roots-pokemon.txt` as well.

  ```
  ash@root:/home$ sudo cat roots-pokemon.txt 
  Pikachu!

  ash@root:/home$ sudo su
  root@root:/home# whoami
  root
  ```

- Hint tells us to check website, so I went to that directory and found another Pokemon.

  ```
  root@root:/var/www/html# cat water-type.txt 
  Ecgudfxq_EcGmP{Ecgudfxq}
  ```

- This is ROT14, I use my own scripts for decoding.

- For the last one, I did some manual exploration but couldn't find it like others. Here's the one-liner `find` command that will list all files with `fire` in it.

  ```
  find / -name '*fire*' -type f 2>/dev/null

  [SNIP!]
  /etc/why_am_i_here?/fire-type.txt
  [SNIP!]
  ```

- There it is, read the file and challenge is done! String is encoded with Base64.

  ```
  root@root:/home/pokemon# cat /etc/why_am_i_here?/fire-type.txt
  UDBrM20wbntDaGFybWFuZGVyfQ==
  
  echo 'UDBrM20wbntDaGFybWFuZGVyfQ==' | base64 -d                                                    
  P0k3m0n{Charmander} 
  ```

## üí¨ Notes & Reflections

- What was challenging in this room for me?
  `Catching all Pokemons.`

- What did I learn?
  `Nothing, just sharpened my enumeration skills.`

- I would recommend this room or any type of CTF challenge to every Cyber Security enthusiast since it will sharpen your skills better than any book/tutorial/course or walkthrough rooms on many different platforms!

- Thank you for reading! Enjoy, Have Fun and Happy Hacking! ü§ü
