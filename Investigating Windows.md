## üîç Investigation starts now

- First connect to the machine with RDP `rdesktop 10.10.241.61`

- Q : `Whats the version and year of the windows machine?` <br>

  A : `Windows Server 2016` <br>

  You can find the details in Settings -> About or with CMD.

  ```
  systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /B /C:"OS Version"
  
  C:\Users\Administrator>systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /B /C:"OS Version"
  OS Name:                   Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Datacenter
  OS Version:                10.0.14393 N/A Build 14393
  ```

- Q : `Which user logged in last? ; Hint - That's you just now. But, who logged in before you?` <br>

  A : `Administrator` <br>

  Open `Event Viewer` and go to `Security` and filter ID to 4624. You can also get the info with PowerShell, you are `SYSTEM`, list is long tho.

  ```
  $Logins = Get-WinEvent -LogName "Security" | Where-Object {$_.Id -eq "4624"}

  ForEach($Login in $Logins)
  {
  $Login.Properties[5]
  }

  PS C:\Users\Administrator> $Logins = Get-WinEvent -LogName "Security" | Where-Object {$_.Id -eq "4624"}
  PS C:\Users\Administrator>
  PS C:\Users\Administrator> ForEach($Login in $Logins)
  >> {
  >> $Login.Properties[5]

- Q : `When did John log onto the system last? Answer format: MM/DD/YYYY H:MM:SS AM/PM ; Hint - Try using cmd to find this out. Please keep the answer format in mind before giving the answer.` <br>

  A : `03/02/2019 5:48:32 PM` <br>
  
  If you still have Event Viewer on, click on `Find` and type `John` then click `Find next` and you'll get the details.

  ```

  This is a PowerShell command for same question. `($Logins | Where-Object {$_.Message -like ‚Äú*John*‚Äù} | Select-Object -First 1).TimeCreated`

  ```
  PS C:\Users\Administrator> ($Logins | Where-Object {$_.Message -like ‚Äú*John*‚Äù} | Select-Object -First 1).TimeCreated

- Q : `What IP does the system connect to when it first starts?` <br>

  A : `10.34.2.3` <br>

  You can find this IP whenever `TMP\p.exe` runs, IP is reflected in CMD. You can also get with `System Information -> Software Environment -> Startup Apps`, there's only one value.

- Q : `What two accounts had administrative privileges (other than the Administrator user)? Answer format: List them in alphabetical order.` <br>

  A : `Guest, Jenny` <br>

  I got it with PowerShell.

  ```
  (Get-LocalGroupMember ‚ÄúAdministrators‚Äù).Name

  PS C:\Users\Administrator> (Get-LocalGroupMember ‚ÄúAdministrators‚Äù).Name
  EC2AMAZ-I8UHO76\Administrator

- Q : `Whats the name of the scheduled task that is malicous.` <br>

  A : `Clean file system` <br>

  I found this one with `Task Scheduler`, you can also get it with PowerShell. In Task Scheduler, `Clean File System` is the only program that has description.

  ```
  Task Scheduler

- OK, so the following command will give you answers for next two questions, `Execute` shows the task, `Arguments` shows the port. Alternatively, Task Scheduler will do the same, select malicious file from previous task and click on `Actions`. <br>

  Q : `What file was the task trying to run daily?` <br>

  A : `nc.ps1` <br>
  
  Q : `What port did this file listen locally for?` <br>

  A : `1348` <br>

  ```
  (Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName ‚ÄúClean file system‚Äù).Actions 

  PS C:\Users\Administrator> (Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName ‚ÄúClean file system‚Äù).Actions
  
  
  Id               :
  Arguments        : -l 1348
  Execute          : C:\TMP\nc.ps1
  WorkingDirectory :
  PSComputerName   :
  ```

- Q : `When did Jenny last logon?` <br>

  A : `Never` <br>

  In Event Viewer you do the same thing like you did with John, it prints error. PowerShell command also showed nothing, but when I ran `net user` I found the answer.

  ```
  net user Jenny

  PS C:\Users\Administrator> net user Jenny
  User name                    Jenny

  Local Group Memberships      *Administrators       *Users
  Global Group memberships     *None
  The command completed successfully.
  ```

- Q : `At what date did the compromise take place? Answer format: MM/DD/YYYY` <br>

  A : `03/02/2019` <br>

  Since I know that all malicious files are in `TMP` directory, I ran the following code in PowerShell.

  ```
  Get-ChildItem C:\TMP | Select-Object Name, CreationTime


  PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-ChildItem C:\TMP | Select-Object Name, CreationTime
  
  Name                  CreationTime

- Q : `During the compromise, at what time did Windows first assign special privileges to a new logon? Answer format: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM/PM ; Hint - 00/00/0000 0:00:49 PM` <br>

  A : `03/02/2019 4:04:49 PM` <br>

  OK, this one will be tricky to find if there was no hint, since hint said that assignment time ended with `:49 PM` that made my job much easier. I found this one with PowerShell but you can also find it with Event Viewer by filterin time and ID's.

  ```
  $Specials = Get-WinEvent -LogName "Security" | Where-Object {$_.Id -eq "4672"}

  PS C:\Users\Administrator> $Specials.TimeCreated

- Q : `What tool was used to get Windows passwords?` <br>

  A : `Mimikatz` <br>

  So for this one I typed Mimikatz by habit but you can find the answer with PowrShell or by manually going to `C:\TMP` and opening the file `mim.out`.

  ```
  Get-Content C:\TMP\mim-out.txt

- The following command will provide answers for both this qusetion and the last question. `Get-Content C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`. You can also manually check `hosts` in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`. <br>

  Q : `What was the attackers external control and command servers IP?` <br>

  A : `76.32.97.132` <br>

  Q : `Check for DNS poisoning, what site was targeted?` <br>

  A : `google.com` <br>

  ```
  Get-Content C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

  # This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
  #
  # This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
  # entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
  # be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
  # The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
  # space.
  #
  # Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
  # lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.

- Q : `What was the extension name of the shell uploaded via the servers website?` <br>

  A : `.jsp` <br>

  For this question, same rule applies like for previous ones. You can either use PowerShell or manually check `C:\inetpub\wwwroot`. Honestly, I prefer scripting since I love Python and I also wanted to practice PowerShell.

  ```
  Get-ChildItem C:\inetpub\wwwroot | Select-Object Name, CreationTime

  PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-ChildItem C:\inetpub\wwwroot | Select-Object Name, CreationTime
  
  Name      CreationTime
  ----      ------------
  b.jsp     3/2/2019 4:47:26 PM
  shell.gif 3/2/2019 4:47:26 PM
  tests.jsp 3/2/2019 4:47:26 PM
  ```

- Q : `What was the last port the attacker opened? ; Hint - Firewall` <br>

  A : `1337` <br>

  PowerShell command is `Get-NetFirewallRule -Direction Inbound` and manually you can open `Firewall -> Inbound Rules -> Select the first rule -> Properties -> Protocols and ports` and you'll find it. PowerShell output was insanely long so for this one I did it manually.

## üí¨ Notes & Reflections

- What was challenging in this room for me?
  `Oh man, a lot of things, when it comes to Windows, there is a big difference between invesitgating Windows as a Blue Teamer and attacking Windows as a Red Teamer.`

- What did I learn?
  `I learner a lot ngl, especially for Blue side, I got so much practice with both PowerShell and Windows in general, I'm so glad that I did this room. Practice makes it perfect!`

- I would recommend this room or any type of CTF challenge to every Cyber Security enthusiast since it will sharpen your skills better than any book/tutorial/course or walkthrough rooms on many different platforms!

- Thank you for reading! Enjoy, Have Fun and Happy Hacking! ü§ü
