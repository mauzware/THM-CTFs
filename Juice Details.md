## Juicy Details - TryHackMe Writeup

[Room Link](https://tryhackme.com/room/juicydetails)

<i>ÔªøIntroduction

You were hired as a SOC Analyst for one of the biggest Juice Shops in the world and an attacker has made their way into your network. 

Your tasks are:

Figure out what techniques and tools the attacker used
What endpoints were vulnerable
What sensitive data was accessed and stolen from the environment
An IT team has sent you a zip file containing logs from the server. Download the attached file, type in "I am ready!" and get to work! There's no time to lose!</i>

## üîç Reconnaissance

- What tools did the attacker use? (Order by the occurrence in the log)? `nmap, hydra, sqlmap, curl, feroxbuster`

- What endpoint was vulnerable to a brute-force attack? `/rest/user/login`

  ```::ffff:192.168.10.5 - - [11/Apr/2021:09:16:30 +0000] "POST /rest/user/login HTTP/1.0" 401 26 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Hydra)"```

- What endpoint was vulnerable to SQL injection? `/rest/products/search`

- What parameter was used for the SQL injection? `q`

  ```
  ::ffff:192.168.10.5 - - [11/Apr/2021:09:29:16 +0000] "GET /rest/products/search?q=1%27%29%20AND%205895%3DCAST%28%28CHR%281[SNIP!]0AND%20%28%27SWvi%27%3D%27SWvi HTTP/1.1" 500 - "-" "sqlmap/1.5.2#stable (http://sqlmap.org)"
  ```
  
- What endpoint did the attacker try to use to retrieve files? (Include the /) `/ftp`

  ```::ffff:192.168.10.5 - - [11/Apr/2021:09:34:33 +0000] "GET /ftp HTTP/1.1" 200 4852 "-" "feroxbuster/2.2.1"```

- Was their brute-force attack successful? If so, what is the timestamp of the successful login? (Yay/Nay, 11/Apr/2021:09:xx:xx +0000) `11/Apr/2021:09:16:31 +0000`

  ```
  Sun Apr 11 09:35:45 2021 [pid 8154] [ftp] OK DOWNLOAD: Client "::ffff:192.168.10.5", "/www-data.bak", 2602 bytes, 544.81Kbyte/sec
  Sun Apr 11 09:36:08 2021 [pid 8154] [ftp] OK DOWNLOAD: Client "::ffff:192.168.10.5", "/coupons_2013.md.bak", 131 bytes, 3.01Kbyte/sec
  ```

- What service and account name were used to retrieve files from the previous question? (service, username) `ftp, anonymous`

## üí¨ Notes & Reflections

- What was challenging in this room for me?
  `Nothing.`

- What did I learn?
  `Nothing new, just practicing log analysis I guess.`

- I would recommend this room or any type of CTF challenge to every Cyber Security enthusiast since it will sharpen your skills better than any book/tutorial/course or walkthrough rooms on many different platforms!

- Thank you for reading! Enjoy, Have Fun and Happy Hacking! ü§ü
