## üö© THM-CTF's

<i>**This repository contains my personal write-ups and guides for TryHackMe CTF's I've completed.**</i>  
<i>**Each file is named after the corresponding CTF room and includes step-by-step notes, commands used, and flags captured during the process.**</i>
<i>**Keep in mind there is no screenshots of actions that I did since these are my personal notes and steps that I did during these challenges, I'll try to provide as much written info as I can.**</i>
