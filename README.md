## üö© THM-CTF's

<i>**This repository contains my personal write-ups and guides for TryHackMe CTF's I've completed.**</i>

<i>**Keep in mind there is no screenshots of actions that I did since these are my personal notes and steps that I did during these challenges, I'll try to provide as much written info as I can.**</i>
