## üí¨ Notes & Reflections

- What was challenging in this room for me?<br>
 `Honestly, nothing much, probably finding the right tools.`<br>

- What did I learn?<br>
 `This was my first experience with Spectrograms, Steganography and some Crypto. I learned a some new things and most imporantly I HAD SO MUCH FUN!`<br>

- I would recommend this room or any type of CTF challenge to every Cyber Security enthusiast since it will sharpen your skills better than any book/tutorial/course or walkthrough rooms on many different platforms!

- Enjoy, Have Fun and Happy Hacking! ü§ü
